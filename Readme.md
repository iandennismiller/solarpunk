# Solarpunk book list

https://iandennismiller.github.io/solarpunk/

I hope this will be a good reference for people seeking to discover Solarpunk readings.
I began this project because I was inspired by online discussions that produced expertly-curated book lists of Solarpunk literature.
I wanted to make something simple to navigate, while providing a little bit of information about each book.
