I hope this will be a good reference for people seeking to discover Solarpunk readings.
I began this project because I was inspired by online discussions that produced expertly-curated book lists of Solarpunk literature.
I wanted to make something simple to navigate, while providing a little bit of information about each book.

The use case I have in mind is: someone hears about Solarpunk and they want to find a Solarpunk book as easily as possible.
First, by collecting a community-curated list of Solarpunk works, we've simplified the process of searching.
Then, by gathering a description and cover art, we've made it much simpler to learn about each book without any extra clicks.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please start by checking out the [source code](https://github.com/iandennismiller/solarpunk/).
The raw book list data are represented as JSON in [_data/](https://github.com/iandennismiller/solarpunk/tree/main/_data).
To add books to a list, consider submitting a pull request directly on github that changes the relevant JSON file.
Please refer to [the JSON template](https://github.com/iandennismiller/solarpunk/tree/main#json-template) in the Readme to learn how to construct new entries.
